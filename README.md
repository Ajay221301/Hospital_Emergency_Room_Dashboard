# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## Description

This project is a dashboard created using Excel to find out meaningful insights on hospital data. </br>The dashboard helps to visualize various aspects of hospital emergency room activities and provides useful analytics.

## Features

- Visualize patient data in the emergency room
- Analyze trends and patterns in hospital data
- Interactive charts and graphs for data exploration
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation

## Files

- `Hospital Emergency Room Data (1).csv`: Contains the raw data of patients' information such as admission dates, demographics, department referrals, satisfaction scores, and more.
- `Hospital_Final_Dashboaerd.png`: An image of the final dashboard created using the data from the CSV file.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel

## Usage

1. Open the `Hospital Emergency Room Data (1).csv` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. Use the data to create charts and graphs as needed.
3. Refer to the `Hospital_Final_Dashboaerd.png` to see the final dashboard layout and design.

## Data Description

The CSV file contains the following columns:
- **Patient Id**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Patient Admission Date**: Date and time the patient was admitted.
- **Patient First Initial**: First initial of the patient's first name.
- **Patient Last Name**: Last name of the patient.
- **Patient Gender**: Gender of the patient.
- **Patient Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Patient Race**: Race of the patient.
- **Department Referral**: Department to which the patient was referred.
- **Patient Admission Flag**: Indicates if the patient was admitted.
- **Patient Satisfaction Score**: Score of patient satisfaction.
- **Patient Waiting Time**: Waiting time for the patient.
- **Is Emergency**: Indicates if it was an emergency case.

## Process Used

### 1. Data Collection
The data used for this project was collected in a CSV file named `Hospital Emergency Room Data (1).csv`. This file contains detailed information about patients, including demographics, admission details, department referrals, satisfaction scores, and waiting times.

### 2. Data Cleaning
The CSV file was imported into Microsoft Excel, where it underwent a thorough data cleaning process. This involved checking for missing values, correcting data entry errors, and ensuring consistency in the data format.

### 3. Data Analysis
Using Excel's built-in tools, various analyses were performed on the cleaned data. This included calculating averages, identifying trends, and creating visual representations of key metrics such as patient demographics, admission rates, and satisfaction scores.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
The final step was to create an interactive dashboard in Excel. This involved designing charts, graphs, and slicers to allow users to filter and explore the data easily. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

### 5. KPI Slicer Implementation
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) slicer was added to the dashboard to enable users to filter data based on specific performance metrics. This slicer helps in quickly identifying key insights and making data-driven decisions.

## Example Analysis

The provided data can be used to perform various analyses, such as:
- Patient demographics distribution
- Average waiting times by department
- Satisfaction scores analysis
- Emergency vs non-emergency cases
